## Ruby overview

Practical exercises in Ruby version 2.x, from Hello World to OOP and advanced features like lambdas.

## Ruby as a programming language

- is not compiled
- reads line by line and executes, uses an interpreter
- no semicolons
- dynamic typing
- everything is an object (offers flexibility to the language)
- very productive
- easy to rewrite, add methods, etc.

Inspired by Lisp, Perl, SmallTalk, Eiffel, Ada.
It seeks to be natural, not simplistic -- it is a very expressive language above formalities
